        <h2>Biography.</h2>
        <p>My name is Benson Mwangi Kimani I am 27 years old, currently working with Greenlife Crop Protection Africa as a field agronomist and a sales agent. I am a newbie in software engineering looking foward to exploring more in this field.  I am currently enrolled to Moringa school learning both front end and back end  programming with high hopes of graduating as a fullstack developer before next year ends. I also have a degree of Arts in Economics and four years experience as an Agronomist and a sales agent for agrochemical products. I am looking forward to charging my carrier to a full time developer and live my dream. The reason why i chose software development is because its one field i feel i will leatrn alot and leave me as a full time learner in order to remain relevant. I am planning to concentarte on Js,Python,React and Ruby on rails in the next 2 years. I am giving my self a grace period of three years to fully master both front end and backend.</p>
